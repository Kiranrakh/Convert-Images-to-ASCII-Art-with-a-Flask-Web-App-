# Convert-Images-to-ASCII-Art-with-a-Flask-Web-App-
Excited to share my ASCII Image Converter Web App that transforms images into ASCII characters! 🖼️➡️🔠

This project is a Flask-based web application that converts uploaded images into ASCII art by mapping pixel intensities to ASCII characters.

📌 Features

✅ Upload an Image – Easily upload any image via the web UI 📤✅ Grayscale Conversion – Transforms the image into shades of gray 🎨✅ ASCII Mapping – Dark areas use @, lighter areas use #, $, ?, etc. ✨✅ Real-time ASCII Generation – Get instant ASCII representation of your image 🖼️✅ Simple & Lightweight – Built with Flask, NumPy, and Pillow for efficiency 🔥

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Flask (Web Framework) 🌐

Pillow (PIL) (Image Processing) 🖼️

NumPy (Pixel Manipulation) 🔢

HTML & CSS (Frontend) 🎨

🚀 Installation & Setup

📸 Example Output

Upload an image, and the web app will generate ASCII art like this:

@@@@###??   
@@@@##??**  
@@@###???**

💡 How It Works

🔹 Step 1: Convert the image to grayscale🔹 Step 2: Resize the image while maintaining aspect ratio (0.55 correction)🔹 Step 3: Map pixel intensities to ASCII characters🔹 Step 4: Display the final ASCII art in the web interface
